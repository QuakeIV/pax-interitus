good idea:
subspace sensor network (to detect jumps)
subspace comms
both are more or less instantaneous
regular sensors are lightspeed but can track any given spacecraft fairly easily unless its very very fast somehow, and you can drop buoys that are in FTL comms
it might actually be better to start out with just magical instant sensors
but the fact remains it might be better to have FTL subspace sensors that detect jumps
